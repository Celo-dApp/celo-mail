Celo Mail is a simple and secure way to recieve email notifications whenever you recieve a payment. Emails are encrypted with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), a encryption chosen by the U.S. government to protect classified information. The same technology used to encrypt classified information is also used to purchasing a coffee on Celo.

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/](http://localhost:3000/api/qr). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/qr.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
